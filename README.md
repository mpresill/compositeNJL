This repository is meant to collect the FeynRules and CalcHEP/UFO models for the model implemented in EPJC (220)80:309 by R. Leonardi et Al.

''HN_FeynRules_model'' contains the implementation of a dim-6 contact interaction in FeynRules for both CalcHEP and Madgraph (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00374.pdf) to be used as a guideline for this new model with NJL interactions.
